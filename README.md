Kikurice is proudly based on **[Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)**, namely Frappe and Mocha.

## Window managers
So far, here are the window managers that Kikurice supports:
- insert WM here
- insert WM 2 here

Each window manager in the list will be linked to its respective document that contains related instructions and whatnot. The list is not concrete; I may add more if needed.

## What are the core utilities?
*NOTE: As the name suggests, these are core dependencies of Kikurice. If you want to use alternatives, do so at your own risk.*
